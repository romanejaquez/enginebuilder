# Flutter Build Engine Web App

A fun and cool Flutter Web App for building a tank engine!

### Features:
- Creating an engine using 6 easy steps:
  - Select the color
  - Select the wheel type
  - Select the whistle type
  - Select the chimney type
  - Add a name and a number
  - Select the face

- Exporting built engine as PNG
- Delete Engine (TBD)
- Save Engine (TBD)
- Load Existing Engine (TBD)

All assets were created by myself. This app was built for my son who loves steam engines and is a big fan of Thomas the Tank Engine series (me too!).
